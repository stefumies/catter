# CAT Game

Another follow along from the Youtube series "Making Games using Odin and Raylib" by Karl Zylinski

This one is an excerpt from his commerical game "Cat and Onion" on Steam, and is a very excellent delve into Making Games 
in the Odin Programming Language using the Raylib Game Engine.

I added my own structure of code as we went along, as Im a pedantic old programmer, the code in the tutorial is much
more unstructured, as its more about learning Odin.
